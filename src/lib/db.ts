// dotenv is not used or needed in Next.js! Environment variables are baked into the runtime and available with `process.env`. Next does natively what dotenv did manually.

// In Next.js, we also don't need to use nodemon. We have something even better. nodemon brutally murders our entire Node process and boots 
// up a brand new one from scratch every single time we save. Next.js uses Fast Refersh which instead only swaps out what has changed. But 
// with this benefits, we also run into problem with the Database Pool. 
// If we just copy-pasted your old db.ts file, Next.js would create a brand new PostgreSQL connection pool every single time we saved a file, 
// quickly maxing out our Aiven database limits and crashing.
// When building a manual backend with Exrpess + nodemon, it's never a problem since the Database Pool dies with the Node process
// Solution: cache the pool in the Node `global` object so that it survives Next.js reloads. `global` is the Node equivalent of the Browser `window` object
const globalForPg = global as unknown as { pgPool: Pool }; // I've never seen two `as` but it's called Double Casting. We go straight from `obejct` -> `{ pgPool: Pool }`, we need a "clean slate" first which is `as unknown`. "TypeScript, forget everything you know about this object."

// This remains mostly unchanged compared to the Biscord code..

    rejectUnauthorized: false, // To fix `no encryption` error
